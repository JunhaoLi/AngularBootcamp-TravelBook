# Travelbook

This is for angular bootcamp session I used for my team learning session. We folloed a very nice tutorial[here](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/)

We build this app step by step, starting from S1 to S21. Below is the list of sessions topics. Be aware that they may not exactly match the branch name but checking the commits will give you hints about the change topics.

* S1 set up environment
* S2 project overview, header component
* S3 component, travel history page I
* S4 basic directives, travel history page II
* S5 data binding, separate travel list/details
* S6 directives, manage button
* S7 service, sign in status passed into app I
* S8 Observable, data service
* S9 Routing I - Routing from HTML
* S10 Routing II - Routing from script
* S11 Routing III - child routes
* S12 Routing IV - Routing guard, enter
* S13 Routing VI - Routing guard, leave
* S14 Form I - Template driven approach
* S15 Form II - Template driven approach
* S16 Form III - Reactive form approach
* S17 Form IV - Reactive approach
* S18 Pipe basics (optional)
* S19 Http I - Firebase setup and fetch/save data
* S20 Http II - data storage and http header/interceptors
* S21 Auth I - Auth token setup
* S22 Auth II - Sending auth request to firebase
* S23 Auth III - Auth guard and interceptor
* S24 Auth IV - Use Auth in app
* S25 Auth V - Auto log in/out
* S26 Module I - optimze our app
* S27 Module II - lazy loading and AOT 
* S28 Module III - environment and deployment

I am planning to add some extra sessions about NgRx, but it is not completed yet.

## Quick look
[Demo](https://angularlearning-hans.firebaseapp.com/home)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build, which is running in demo site.

* master branch is clean project created by angular cli
* develop branch is same as master (will be updated to complete status)
* s[number]_[topic] branch means the branch for session [number] with [topic]

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
